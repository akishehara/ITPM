Background to the study in todayâ€™s developing era, the number of vehicles is increasing most over the planet. Providing efficient service to every vehicle user may be a challenging task for garages, vehicle parts shops, fuel stations, and insurance companies in the future. And vehicle users need to substitute queues for getting service. Garage services, insurance for vehicles, fuel stations, and spare parts shops are essential components of the automobile industry in Sri Lanka. For automobiles to remain in good condition and last for a long time, as well as to provide owners of those vehicles peace of mind, these services must be accessible. Sri Lanka has a thriving automobile sector, and numerous shops and service providers meet the demands of drivers. 

Vehicle insurance is a crucial component of the sector because it protects against unforeseen accidents, theft, and damage to cars. Many insurance providers in Sri Lanka offer comprehensive car insurance plans and packages that cover third-party liability, collision, and theft. Vehicle owners have a selection of insurance options to fit their demands and budgets. There are many stores such as spare parts, oil, tire, and different kind of stores related to vehicles. These stores offer a broad selection of replacement parts for several types of vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, and trucks. Genuine or aftermarket components are offered to customers at competitive pricing. The demand for spare parts has expanded along with the number of vehicles on Sri Lankan roads, making spare parts shops a crucial component of the sector. Fuel stations are an essential part of Sri Lanka's transportation infrastructure. With the increasing number of vehicles on the roads in Sri Lanka, fuel stations have become a crucial component of the country's economy and transportation system.  

There are websites in Sri Lanka that provide these services online but on separate websites for each service. On our website, users can get these services on one website and interact easily and get the service faster.

This Garage Management System will assist users in keeping track of all garage operations.

Using this application, the user can locate the nearby active garages/mechanics, shops, and fuel stations and communicate with them to urge service in need. the aim of designing this application is to facilitate the user also as a service provider (garage, insurance company, fuel station, shop) Users are going to be benefited because they did not get to move the garage which ultimately saves time, effort, and money. On the opposite hand (for the garage, insurance company, fuel station, and shop) the number of users increases, which increases the turnover and provides a high return on investment.
